### Exercises:

Here you will find links to each exercise's solution, pointing to the specific GitHub release and the relevant directory within that release.

* **1.1. Exercise Title (e.g., Log Output App):**
    * [Link to Release 1.1](https://github.com/hassantimothy/K8S_MOOC_submissions/releases/tag/1.1)
    * *Direct link to app directory:* `https://github.com/hassantimothy/K8S_MOOC_submissions/tree/1.1/1.1-exercise_directory_name`
    *(Replace `1.1-exercise_directory_name` with your actual directory name, e.g., `1.1-log_output`)*

* **1.2. Exercise Title (e.g., Web Server):**
    * [Link to Release 1.2](https://github.com/hassantimothy/K8S_MOOC_submissions/releases/tag/1.2)
    * *Direct link to app directory:* `https://github.com/hassantimothy/K8S_MOOC_submissions/tree/1.2/1.2-exercise_directory_name`

* **2.1. Exercise Title (e.g., Kubernetes Deployment):**
    * [Link to Release 2.1](https://github.com/hassantimothy/K8S_MOOC_submissions/releases/tag/2.1)

**How to Navigate This Repository:**

* **Directory Structure:** Each exercise solution is organized into its own numbered directory (e.g., `1.1-log_output`, `1.2-web_server`).
* **Application READMEs:** Inside each exercise's directory, you'll find a dedicated `README.md` file. This file provides specific instructions on how to set up, build, run, and interact with that particular application or Kubernetes configuration.
* **GitHub Releases:** For a precise snapshot of the code as submitted for a specific exercise, click on the "Link to Release X.X" above. These releases correspond to the tags required by the course.

---

**Important Notes for Course Submission:**

* **Releases:** A GitHub Release is created for every exercise, with the tag name matching the exercise number (e.g., `1.1`, `1.2`).
* **Links:** All links in this `README.md` point to the corresponding GitHub Release and the relevant directory within that release.
* **Accessibility:** This repository is public and accessible to the GitHub user `mluukkai`.
